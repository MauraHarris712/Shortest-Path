1. Within the PA3 code I augmented 3 files in order to find the shortest path no matter the data type cities or routers. In the main folder in PA3 I created a new Dijkstra's object which will start the constructor within the object. The GraphMaker file reads in a filename from the user and recreates the file analyzing the structure of the graph. In Dijkstras, the user from the user is chosen and runShortestPath along with shortestPath is called upon the file.  


2. The only unusual thing you might find would be the code for the path to be printed as I was unable to find a method of traversing through the hashmap without declaring the amount of paths ahead of time.Other then that I hope you don’t find anything unusual or expected.
3. sample output from your program for each of the input file
